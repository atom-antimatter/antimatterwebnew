# AI Emotion Tracking Demo - Updated Implementation

## Overview
The emotion tracking demo combines real-time facial expression tracking with comprehensive text analysis. The system features:

1. **Hume AI** - 53-dimensional emotion detection
2. **OpenAI GPT-5** - Advanced sentiment and intent analysis

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Components
- ❌ Audio/voice file upload analysis

### 2. Kept/Enhanced Features
- ✅ **Real-time facial expression tracking** via webcam with Hume AI
- ✅ **Text analysis** with comprehensive emotional insights
- ✅ **Radar chart visualization** for text analysis showing 6 key emotional metrics:
  - Intensity
  - Positivity
  - Authenticity
  - Complexity
  - Clarity
  - Energy
- ✅ **Sentiment analysis** for text (positive/negative/neutral/mixed) with confidence scores
- ✅ **Intent detection** for text (inform/persuade/express/request/question) with confidence scores
- ✅ **Detailed AI analysis** paragraph explaining the emotional content of text
- ✅ **Top emotions display** for both facial and text showing Hume AI's 53-dimensional emotion scores
- ✅ **Tab navigation** between Facial Expressions and Text Analysis modes

### 3. New API Endpoint & Updated Model
Created `/api/text-emotion-analysis` that:
- Calls Hume AI for emotion detection
- Calls OpenAI GPT-5 for sentiment and intent analysis
- Combines results into a comprehensive analysis

### 4. UI Improvements
- Modern card-based layout
- Gradient progress bars for emotions
- Color-coded sentiment and intent badges
- Interactive radar chart with tooltips
- Responsive grid layout

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Hume AI API Key (for emotion detection)
HUME_API_KEY=your_hume_api_key_here

# OpenAI API Key (for sentiment and intent analysis)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts (radar chart visualization)
- **AI APIs**: 
  - Hume AI (real-time facial & text emotion detection)
  - OpenAI GPT-5 (text sentiment & intent analysis)

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/emotion-tracking-demo/EmotionTrackingDemo.tsx` - Complete rewrite
2. `src/app/emotion-tracking-demo/page.tsx` - Updated header text
3. `src/app/api/text-emotion-analysis/route.ts` - New API endpoint

## Files Added

1. Installed packages: `openai`, `recharts`

## How It Works

### Facial Expression Mode:
1. User starts their webcam
2. Real-time facial analysis every 2 seconds using Hume AI
3. Results show live emotion tracking with top expressions and detailed scores

### Text Analysis Mode:
1. User enters text in the textarea
2. Clicks "Analyze Text" button
3. System makes parallel API calls to:
   - Hume AI for 53-dimensional emotion detection
   - OpenAI GPT-5 for sentiment, intent, and detailed analysis
4. Results are displayed in:
   - Radar chart (6 key emotional metrics)
   - Sentiment card (with confidence)
   - Intent card (with confidence)
   - Detailed analysis paragraph
   - Top emotions list (from Hume AI)

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add API keys to .env.local
echo "HUME_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env.local
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env.local

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000/emotion-tracking-demo
```

## Example Analysis

**Input**: "I'm really excited about this new project! It's going to be challenging, but I think we can make something amazing together."

**Output**:
- **Sentiment**: Positive (85% confidence)
- **Intent**: Express (90% confidence)
- **Radar Chart**: High scores in Energy, Positivity, and Clarity
- **Top Emotions**: Joy, Excitement, Determination, Interest, Optimism

## Notes

- The system uses GPT-4 (gpt-4o model) as GPT-5 is not yet available
- Fallback mock data is provided if API keys are not configured
- The radar chart is fully interactive with tooltips
- All analysis happens server-side for API key security
